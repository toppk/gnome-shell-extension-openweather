OpenWeather (*gnome-shell-extension-openweather*) is a simple extension for displaying weather conditions and forecasts for any location on Earth in the GNOME Shell. It provides support for multiple locations with editable names using coordinates to store the locations, a beautiful layout, and more.

Weather data is fetched from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) including 3 hour forecasts for up to 5 days.

## Installation

After completing one of the installation methods below, restart GNOME Shell (*Xorg: `Alt`+`F2`, `r`, `Enter` - Wayland: `log out` or `reboot`*) and enable the extension through the *gnome-extensions* app.

### Official E.G.O Release

Visit OpenWeather on the [Official GNOME Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/750/openweather) website.

### Package Manager

These are the currently available 'official' release packages that align with the E.G.O release version. There is a [package in the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnome-shell-extension-openweather) that I maintain myself, and `Artem Polishchuk` maintains a package in the [official Fedora repos](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gnome-shell-extension-openweather).

Installing the extension this way provides a system wide installation.

#### Arch Linux

Install using your favourite AUR helper, for example:

```
paru -S gnome-shell-extension-openweather
```

#### Fedora

To install from the official fedora repos simply run:

```
sudo dnf install gnome-shell-extension-openweather
```
